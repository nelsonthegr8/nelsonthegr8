## Tinker Projects
- Created a mini can light using an arduino nano, servo's, and my 3d printer. Multi color led changes when anolog is pressed down and a long press turns the led light off. The anolog also controls the movements of the bottom and top servo to position the light.
- Created a auto shot timer device for consistent green shots in NBA 2k24. Using an arduino nano again and my 3d printer. I rigged up this device to my xbox controller and when i press the button on my device it will hold down my x button for however many milliseconds i set it to so that my shot is released at the same time every time.
